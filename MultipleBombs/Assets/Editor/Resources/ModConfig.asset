  description: "What's better than a bomb? Two bombs! Take your multitasking skills
    to a new level by defusing two independent bombs at the same time! Two separate
    serials, two separate widget collections, two separate timers, and more!\nYou
    can easily change the mod settings from an option in the Free Play menu.\nAlso,
    it can work together with custom bomb casings and custom gameplay rooms, so that
    you can have total control over customization!\n\n[h1]For mod developers[/h1]\nThe
    mod exposes various APIs that other mod developers can use. For example it allows
    to customize bomb spanws in a Gameplay Room, to build missions with multiple bombs
    and much more!\nTo learn how to use it and for explanation about all of its features
    read the API Docs at [url=https://lupo511.github.io/ktanemods/MultipleBombs/docs/]https://lupo511.github.io/ktanemods/MultipleBombs/docs/[/url].\n\n[h1]Credits[/h1]\nFor
